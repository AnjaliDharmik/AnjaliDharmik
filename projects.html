We addressed the problem of an imbalanced dataset with various techniques such as data oversampling (augmenting the existing data samples) and data sample generation. After 6 months of the model development Customer benefits in Cost Reduction and Customer Satisfaction. Our client’s online card transaction platform became a safer service and gained more loyalty from their customers.</p>
